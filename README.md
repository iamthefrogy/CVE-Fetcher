# CVE-Fetcher
🚀 Excited to share my latest and very tiny and simple #opensource script on GitHub - a very simple, yet useful CVE details fetcher script! 🌐

This handy #bash script is created to automate the process of fetching relevant details about a specific CVE ID, including its description and affected products.

Some of the use cases I could think of for various domains in #cybersecurity are:

𝗩𝘂𝗹𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 🛡️ - Teams quickly identify the affected packages and their version numbers to analyze how large or small their attack surface within their company. Whether they use these products/packages or not, and this can help prioritization for the remediation efforts.

𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 🕵️‍♂️ - Analysts can gather actionable insights on emerging threats by searching products they own in their company and related CVEs or vice versa, making it easier to create tailored, up-to-date threat briefings for clients.

𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿 (𝗦𝗢𝗖) 🚨 - Save precious time during incident response by automating the process of gathering CVE information, allowing SOC analysts to concentrate on containment and mitigation strategies.

By adding simple for/while loop you can also supply multiple CVEs through input file.
